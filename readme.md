# **Basic Working**
Our project utilizes a muscle sensor to detect muscle movements, which are then transmitted to a NodeMCU. The NodeMCU analyzes the signals to differentiate between single and double muscle movements. .The Raspberry Pi receives these messages and controls the light and fan accordingly. For example, if it receives a message indicating a single muscle movement, it turns down the light. If it receives a message indicating a double muscle movement, it turns on the fan.

## Muscle Sensor
Muscle sensors are devices that measure electric signals generated by muscle activity. They can be used to control devices such as lights and fans with simple gestures.

## MQTT
Through MQTT communication, the NodeMCU sends messages containing the movement information to a Raspberry Pi acting as an MQTT broker . The Raspberry Pi receives these messages and controls the light and fan accordingly.
